Table names:

STATISTICS: data extracted from inferential statistics such as ANOVA results
OR: data collected to calculate odds ratio (proportion/number of events)
HEDGES: data collected to calculate Hedges'g (mean and standard deviation)
protection: data collected from hosts under attack of natural enemies (protection data)
costhost: data collected from hosts that were not under attack of natural enemies (cost to the host data)
naturalenemy: data collected from natural enemies infecting hosts harboring or not symbionts (cost to the natural enemy data)

Table coding:

Symbiont_spp: Symbiont species
Symbio_line: Line/strain of the symbiont species
Symbio_type: If symbiont is natural or was introduced/transinfected into the host species
Symbio_introgression: How symbiont was introgressed into the host species
